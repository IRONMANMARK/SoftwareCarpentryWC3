### About the webpage:
I was using a webpage that was built by me somtimes ago. It was originally used for iGEM competition that I joined. I decided to make best use of it one more time. To visit the old site just click "Journey Begin". Also, I have add somthing new to it that is you can run Python code through my server.
### About runing Python code on my webpage:
Click "Run python code on my server" to jump to the server webpage that can run Python code.
## About the warning you may get when visit the webpage on my server:
You may get a warning says there may have somthing wrong with the credential. 
* Just ignore it and click continue to the webpage.<br>
Don't worry about it, because I need SSL to encrypt the connection between you and my server to make it safe. But the cridential I used is not known to a credible third party thus returns the warning. So, just relax, there is noting wrong when you visit my server webpage.
